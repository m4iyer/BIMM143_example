Scientific Question: Are mice such good animal models for diabetes because the insulin receptor substrate-1 gene (IRS1) is similar between mice and humans?

Scientific Hypothesis: If IRS1 is a probable gene for causing type 2 diabetes and mice and humans have similar endocrine systems, then the IRS1 gene sequence and structure between the two animals will be very similar.
